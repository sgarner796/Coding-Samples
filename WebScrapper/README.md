# Scrapper

Here I made a webscraper for a final project were we wanted to find if there were any indicators that could tell us how many migrants from the southern border are going to arrive in Chicago using past announcement by Texas Governor Abbot, it extracts all announcements (Tittle, Data and Link) by the Governors office, with that we are able to filter out each mention of "Operation Lone Star" and download the whole body of the article, with that I then extracted the number of how many newcomers are going to each city.
