#GIS

This is a map of inequality in Tegucigalpa Honduras, i used census data that collected info on unmet basic needs which was associated with a particular neighborhood, with that i used publicly available COPECO shapefiles and match each neighborhood with its associated unmet basic need score, in general inequality grows out from the center of the city which is interesting cause that is were the first building of tegucigalpa is! The church!

I also plotted importan buildings such as school and hospitals to see if resources are allocated to richer areas of Tegucigalpa.

I hope anyone who sees this finds its exciting too!

I included csv of datamanipulation i did for the census and COPECO data, everything else can be found in the internet
