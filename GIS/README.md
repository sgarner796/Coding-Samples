This is a map of inequality in Tegucigalpa Honduras, i used census data that collected info on unmet basic needs which was associated with a particular neighborhood, with that i used publicly available COPECO shapefiles and match each neighborhood with its associated unmet basic need score, in general inequality grows out from the center of the city which is interesting cause that is were the first building of tegucigalpa is! The church!

I hope anyone who sees this finds its exciting too!
